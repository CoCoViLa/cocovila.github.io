        <p class="lead">The objective of a CoCoViLa demo package for dynamic simulation of hydraulic elements is to demonstrate using multi-pole models for modeling and simulation of real-scale mechatronic systems. The package covers a small part of modeling and simulation systems investigated and developed by the joint research group of the Institute of Cybernetics and the Department of Mechanics at Tallinn University of Technology.
The package includes models of low level hydraulic elements such as hydraulic resistors, hydraulic tubes, interface elements, and also hydraulic fluids, simulation process manager, supporting elements for defining inputs and outputs and few example tasks for simulation hydraulic schemes. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">HVACmodel</h2>
        <p class="lead">Nowadays, the big amount of energy is spent in buildings, mainly in such sub- systems as heating, ventilation and cooling. Reducing energy consumption in this field is a trend, because of economic and environmental issues.

 We try to model the energy consumption for heating/cooling air in simple building, which is modeled by one volume. Energy dissipation depends on the dimensions of building, the materials from which the house is built and outside temperature. But energy consumption can be reduced by efficient control of heating or cooling. 
   We propose a CoCoViLa package for modeling and simulation of HVAC systems. The system consists of several components, such as: building description, heater/cooler, controller, thermostat, electric heater, occupants, ventilation etc. The simulation results can help to choose parameters for comfort temperature, properties of the heater/cooler and modify the control algorithms. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Dynamic System Simulator</h2>
        <p class="lead">Every scheme should have one Simulator - a Simulation Engine that possess the simulation properties like simulation time and time step (or a number of simulation steps in a time unit), and acts as a supervisor during the simulation execution. The Simulator must be set as super from the Properties window (make double-click or right-click on the image on the scheme to acces the menu).</p>

  <p class="lead">You can set the Graph object to display several inputs - the number is unlimited.</p>

  <p class="lead">To execute a simulation choose Scheme>Run.</p>

  <p class="lead">Have Fun! :)</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mealy Machine</h2>
<p class="lead">A CoCoViLa package that allows drawing Mealy machine state charts for System Simulators.</p>

<p class="lead">A state chart is composed of Initial State and one or more States. It may have an End State. The states are to be connected with Transitions. The Transitions are driven by conditional expressions based on which it is decided which of then is taken. When there are several conditions exiting the current State that can be used by the conditional expression the one that falls first after sorting them by name is used.</p>

<p class="lead">Every Transition hava an action field that is executed when the Transition is used.</p>

<p class="lead">A state chart in the current implementation should have always one Initial State and a MealyMachineSupervisor block. The latter must be set as super from the preferences menu.</p>
